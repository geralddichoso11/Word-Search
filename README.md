# Word-Search

The following program creates a word search from a file that contains
a list of words. The program contains a class that makes a grid of
letters and manages them as well. When the user enters an invalid
file, it will prompt the user to enter another file name. Once the
user enters a valid file name they now can play the game. The user is
asked to enter a word they're searching for, a starting position (x &
y-coordinates), and a cardinal direction (N, SE, W, etc). If a word
from the list is found, the program will capitalize it in the word
search. Once there's no more words on the list, then the game ends.
